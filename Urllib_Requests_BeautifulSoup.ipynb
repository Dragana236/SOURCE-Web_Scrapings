Beautiful Soup is here to help. Since 2004, it\\'s been\\nsaving programmers hours or days of work on quick-turnaround\\nscreen scraping projects.\\n\\nBeautiful Soup\\n\"A tremendous boon.\" -- Python411 Podcast\\n[ Download | Documentation | Hall of Fame | Source | Discussion group  | Zine ]\\nIf Beautiful Soup has saved you a lot of time and money, one way to pay me back is to read Tool Safety, a short zine I wrote about what I learned about software development from working on Beautiful Soup. Thanks! \\nIf you have questions, send them to the discussion\\ngroup. If you find a bug, file it.\\nBeautiful Soup is a Python library designed for quick turnaround\\nprojects like screen-scraping. Three features make it powerful:\\n\\n\\nBeautiful Soup provides a few simple methods and Pythonic idioms\\nfor navigating, searching, and modifying a parse tree: a toolkit for\\ndissecting a document and extracting what you need. It doesn\\'t take\\nmuch code to write an application\\n\\nBeautiful Soup automatically converts incoming documents to\\nUnicode and outgoing documents to UTF-8. You don\\'t have to think\\nabout encodings, unless the document doesn\\'t specify an encoding and\\nBeautiful Soup can\\'t detect one. Then you just have to specify the\\noriginal encoding.\\n\\nBeautiful Soup sits on top of popular Python parsers like lxml and html5lib, allowing you\\nto try out different parsing strategies or trade speed for\\nflexibility.\\n\\n\\nBeautiful Soup parses anything you give it, and does the tree\\ntraversal stuff for you. You can tell it \"Find all the links\", or\\n\"Find all the links of class externalLink\", or \"Find all the\\nlinks whose urls match \"foo.com\", or \"Find the table heading that\\'s\\ngot bold text, then give me that text.\"\\n\\nValuable data that was once locked up in poorly-designed websites\\nis now within your reach. Projects that would have taken hours take\\nonly minutes with Beautiful Soup.\\n\\nInterested? Read more.\\nDownload Beautiful Soup\\nThe current release is Beautiful Soup\\n4.6.0 (May 7, 2017). You can install Beautiful Soup 4 with\\npip install beautifulsoup4.\\n\\nIn Debian and Ubuntu, Beautiful Soup is available as the\\npython-bs4 package (for Python 2) or the\\npython3-bs4 package (for Python 3). In Fedora it\\'s\\navailable as the python-beautifulsoup4 package.\\n\\nBeautiful Soup is licensed under the MIT license, so you can also\\ndownload the tarball, drop the bs4/ directory into almost\\nany Python application (or into your library path) and start using it\\nimmediately. (If you want to do this under Python 3, you will need to\\nmanually convert the code using 2to3.)\\n\\nBeautiful Soup 4 works on both Python 2 (2.7+) and Python 3.\\n\\nBeautiful Soup 3\\nBeautiful Soup 3 was the official release line of Beautiful Soup\\nfrom May 2006 to March 2012. It is considered stable, and only\\ncritical security bugs will be fixed. Here\\'s\\nthe Beautiful Soup 3 documentation.\\nBeautiful Soup 3 works only under Python 2.x. It is licensed under\\nthe same license as Python itself.\\n\\nThe current release of Beautiful Soup 3 is 3.2.1 (February 16,\\n2012). You can install Beautiful Soup 3 with pip install\\nBeautifulSoup. It\\'s also available as\\npython-beautifulsoup in Debian and Ubuntu, and as\\npython-BeautifulSoup in Fedora.\\n\\nYou can also download the tarball and use\\nBeautifulSoup.py in your project directly.\\n\\n\\nHall of Fame\\nOver the years, Beautiful Soup has been used in hundreds of\\ndifferent projects. There\\'s no way I can list them all, but I want to\\nhighlight a few high-profile projects. Beautiful Soup isn\\'t what makes\\nthese projects interesting, but it did make their completion easier:\\n\\n\\n\"Movable\\n Type\", a work of digital art on display in the lobby of the New\\n York Times building, uses Beautiful Soup to scrape news feeds.\\n\\nReddit uses Beautiful Soup to parse\\na page that\\'s been linked to and find a representative image.\\n\\nAlexander Harrowell uses Beautiful Soup to track the business\\n activities of an arms merchant.\\n\\nThe developers of Python itself used Beautiful Soup to migrate the Python\\nbug tracker from Sourceforge to Roundup.\\n\\nThe Lawrence Journal-World\\nuses Beautiful Soup to gather\\nstatewide election results.\\n\\nThe NOAA\\'s Forecast\\nApplications Branch uses Beautiful Soup in TopoGrabber, a script for\\ndownloading \"high resolution USGS datasets.\"\\n\\n\\nIf you\\'ve used Beautiful Soup in a project you\\'d like me to know\\nabout, please do send email to me or the discussion\\ngroup.\\n\\nDevelopment\\nDevelopment happens at Launchpad. You can get the source\\ncode or file\\nbugs.\\nThis document (source) is part of Crummy, the webspace of Leonard Richardson (contact information).
